# Beta Version 1.15.0

## Added

* Added experience replay capabilities to SARSA neural network and Q-learning neural network models.

* Added OneVsAll under "Others" to convert any binary classification models itno multi class ones.

## Fixes

* Fixed KMedoids and KMeans calculations.

* Fixed bugs related to Affinity Propagation model. 

## Changes

* Changed the ModelChecking to ModelChecker. Also changed a lot of its functionalities.

* Changed the GradientDescentModes to GradientDescentModifier. Also changed a lot of its functionalities.

* Some of the classification models now returns predictedLabelVector as opposed to single value.

* Made the codes for clustering models more readable.

* Changed the outputs for a number of classification and clustering algorithms. 

* Removed SupportVectorMachineOneVsAll and LogisticRegressionOneVsAll.
