# Beta Version 1.34.0

## Added

* Added DiagonalGaussianPolicy and placed it under QuickSetups section.

* Added a new parameter for reinforce() function to AsynchronousAdvantageActorCritic model.

* Added diagonalGaussianUpdate() function to AsynchronousAdvantageActorCritic model.

## Changes

* Renamed ReinforcementLearningQuickSetup to CategoricalPolicy and placed it under QuickSetups section. Also made some modification to the internal code.

* ReinforcementLearningBaseModel's and ReinforcementLearningActorCriticBaseModel's setUpdateFunction() and update() functions have been replaced with setCategoricalUpdateFunction(), setDiagonalGaussianUpdateFunction(), categoricalUpdate() and diagonalGaussianUpdate().

* Made internal code changes to all reinforcement learning algorithms in the library.

* Made a few API breaking changes related to the AsynchronousAdvantageActorCritic model:

	* Renamed update() function to categoricalUpdate().

	* Renamed reset() function to resetAll().
