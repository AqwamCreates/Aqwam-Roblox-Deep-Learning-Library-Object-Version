# Release Version 1.7

## Models

* Added numberOfIterationsPerCostCalculation() function to BaseModel to reduce the amount of resources needed to update the model parameters.

* For some reason, I accidentally added generateLayers() inside train() function for NeuralNetwork model. I have readded this.
