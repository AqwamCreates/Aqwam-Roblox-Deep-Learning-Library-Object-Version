# Release Version 1.17

## Models

* Improved calculations related to calculation of cost function derivatives involving both regularization and optimers.

* LongShortTermMemory and RecurrentNeuralNetwork models as these do not work well with the current API.

* Made some bug fixing.

## Others

* Refactored RandomNetworkDistillation so that it no longer inherits NeuralNetwork. Please use setModel() function to add neural network model to it. Also added deep copy option for TargetModelParameters and PredictorModelParameters.

* Regularization no longer need number of data, instead the gradient method models will handle the operations related to it instead.
