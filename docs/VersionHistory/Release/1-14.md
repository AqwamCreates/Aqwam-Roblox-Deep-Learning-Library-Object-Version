## Models

* Added GradientMethodBaseModel in "Models" for gradient descent / ascent based models. LinearRegression, LogisticRegression and NeuralNetwork now inherits this base model.

* Refactored all the reinforcement learning models. Now the models do not support reinforce() and some other functions as they are moved to ReinforcementLearningQuickSetup in "Others".

## Others

* Added DistributedGradients in "Others" section for distributed gradient descent / ascent training.

* Renamed DistributedLearning to DistributedTraining in "Others".

* Added ReinforcementLearningQuickSetup in "Others" for easier maintainability for reinforcement learning models.
