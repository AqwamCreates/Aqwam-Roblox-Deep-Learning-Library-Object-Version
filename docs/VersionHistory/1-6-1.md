# Version 1.6.1

## Added

* None

## Fixes

* None

## Changes

* The layer matrices will be only generated upon training for neural networks. Previously, it was generated upon calling createLayers() and addLayer() functions.

* Made neural network calculations more efficient by concatenating bias matrix to feature matrix when calling train() and predict() functions. Previously it was concatenated when calling the forward propagate function.
