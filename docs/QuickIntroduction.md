## Quick Introduction

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is a way for computers to predict information based on the data we given to them. Machine learning can do three main tasks: Regression, Classification and Clustering.

### Tasks:

* Regression: Generates a continuous value (e.g. -1.1, 2.09, 20) from given data.

* Classification: Generates a discrete value (e.g. 1, 2, 3), mainly for classifying given data.

* Clustering: Generates centroids (center of data) based on the given data and predict which centroids that a data belongs to.

### What is deep learning?

It is a more advanced version of machine learning. The training techniques are significantly improved and models are more complex compared to machine learning.

### Use Cases:

LinearRegression:

* Make prediction on how long will a player reach certain level

* Spawn an enemy where the difficulty is based on input

LogisticRegression:

* Make an enemy that makes decision between 2 choices (e.g. fighting and running)

* Detect hacking players

KMeans:

* Group players in terms of experience level

SupportVectorMachine

* Detect hacking players
