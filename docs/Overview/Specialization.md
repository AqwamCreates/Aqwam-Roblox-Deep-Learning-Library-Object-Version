# What are Specialization?

Specialization is where the model have been "evolved" to have additional features without changing much of its functionality.

Although it may sound something it had been researched, it it mainly my (Aqwam) new discovery that is not found in any research literature.
You can consider them as "experimental" models, but I have confirmed it to be working.

The models that have specialization are Neural Networks. So go ahead and check them out!
