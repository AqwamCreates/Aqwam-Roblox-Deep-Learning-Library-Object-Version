# What are Modded Models?

Modded Models is where the model have been "evolved" to have additional features without changing much of its functionality.
To use them, you must use the constructors of the model. Then use some functions provided under specialization section of a model (if it exists).

Although it may sound something it had been researched, it it mainly my (Aqwam) new discovery that is not found in any research literature.
You can consider them as "experimental" models, but I have confirmed it to be working.

The models that have specialization are [Neural Networks](../API/Models/NeuralNetwork.md). So go ahead and check them out!
