$ What Is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a way for our models to learn on its own without the labels.

We can expect our models to perform poorly at the start of the training but they will gradually improve over time.

# Getting Started

Most of the reinforcement learning neural netwworks here uses reward values to train our models. There are three variants of neural networks that follow this rule:

* Deep Q-Learning / DQN

* Deep SARSA

* Deep Expected SARSA

All these models contains reinforce() function and have similar input parameters. We will focus on Deep Q-Learning, but we can also apply what you will learn to the other two as well.
