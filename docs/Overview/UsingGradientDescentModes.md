# What is gradient descent?

Gradient descent is one of the way on how our machine/deep learning model "learn" things. The model attempts to find the best possible solution through this technique.

# Types Of Gradient Descents

* Batch Gradient Descent: All data is used to train the model in one go.

* Mini Batch Gradient Descent: All the data is separated to multiple groups and the model will be trained based on the grouped data.

* Stochastic Gradient Descent: The model will be trained on individual data.
