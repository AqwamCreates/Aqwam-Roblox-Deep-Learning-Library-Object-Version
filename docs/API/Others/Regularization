# API Reference - Others - Regularization

## Constructors

### new()

Creates a new regularization object. If any of the arguments are not given, default argument values for that argument will be used.

```
Regularization.new(lambda: number, regularisationMode: string): RegularizationObject
```

#### Parameters:

* lambda: regularization factor

* regularisationMode: the mode which regularization will be used. Currently available ones are "L1" (or "Lasso"), "L2" (or "Ridge") and "L1+L2" (or "ElasticNet")

#### Returns:

* RegularizationObject: The generated regularization object.

## Functions

Set regularizationâ€™s parameters. When any of the arguments are not given, previous argument values for that argument will be used.

```
Regularization:setParameters(lambda: number, regularisationMode: string): RegularizationObject
```

#### Parameters:

* lambda: regularization factor

* regularisationMode: the mode which regularization will be used. Currently available ones are "L1" (or "Lasso"), "L2" (or "Ridge") and "L1+L2" (or "ElasticNet")
