# [API Reference](../../API.md) - [Models](../Models.md) - DoubleQLearningNeuralNetworkV1 (DDQN / Double Deep Q-Learning)

DoubleQLearningNeuralNetworkV1 is a neural network with reinforcement learning capabilities. It can predict any positive numbers of discrete values.

It uses Hasselt et al. (2010) version, where a single neural network is selected from two neural networks with equal probability for training.

## Stored Model Parameters

Contains a table of matrices.  

* ModelParameters[L][I][J]: Matrix at layer L. Value of matrix at row I and column J.

## Constructors

### new()

Create new model object. If any of the arguments are nil, default argument values for that argument will be used.

```
DoubleQLearningNeuralNetwork.new(maxNumberOfIterations: integer, learningRate: number, targetCost: number, maxNumberOfEpisodes: integer, epsilon: number, epsilonDecayFactor: number, discountFactor: number): ModelObject
```

#### Parameters:

* maxNumberOfIterations: How many times should the model needed to be trained.

* learningRate: The speed at which the model learns. Recommended that the value is set between (0 to 1).

* targetCost: The cost at which the model stops training.

* maxNumberOfEpisodes: The number of episodes to decay the epsilon value.

* epsilon: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on exploration over exploitation. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* epsilonDecayFactor: The higher the value, the slower the epsilon decays. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

#### Returns:

* ModelObject: The generated model object.

## Functions

### setParameters()

Set model's parameters. When any of the arguments are nil, previous argument values for that argument will be used.

```
DoubleQLearningNeuralNetwork:setParameters(maxNumberOfIterations: integer, learningRate: number, targetCost: number, maxNumberOfEpisodes: integer, epsilon: number, epsilonDecayFactor: number, discountFactor: number)
```

#### Parameters:

* maxNumberOfIterations: How many times should the model needed to be trained.

* learningRate: The speed at which the model learns. Recommended that the value is set between (0 to 1).

* targetCost: The cost at which the model stops training.

* maxNumberOfEpisodes: The number of episodes to decay the epsilon value.

* epsilon: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on exploration over exploitation. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* epsilonDecayFactor: The higher the value, the slower the epsilon decays. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

* discountFactor: The higher the value, the more likely it focuses on long-term outcomes. The value must be set between 0 and 1.

### setModelParametersArray()

Sets model parameters to be used by the model.

```
DoubleQLearningNeuralNetwork:setModelParametersArray(ModelParameters1: ModelParameters, ModelParameters2: ModelParameters)
```

#### Parameters:

* ModelParameters1: First model parameters to be used by the model.

* ModelParameters2: Second model parameters to be used by the model.

### getModelParametersArray()

Gets model parameters array used by the model. It contains two model parameters.

```
DoubleQLearningNeuralNetwork:getModelParametersArray(): ModelParameters
```

#### Returns:

* ModelParametersArray: An array containing all the model parameters.
