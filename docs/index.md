# Welcome to Aqwam's Roblox Machine And Deep Learning Library!

This project is to address the lack of machine and deep learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones. It is also a way for me to apply my machine and deep learning knowledge into its physical form.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

## Quick Introduction

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is a way for computers to predict information based on the data we given to them. Machine learning can do three main tasks: Regression, Classification and Clustering.

### Tasks:

* Regression: Generates a continuous value (e.g. -1.1, 2.09, 20) from given data.

* Classification: Generates a discrete value (1, 2, 3), mainly for grouping things together.

* Clustering: Generates centroids (center of data) based on the given data and predict which centroids that a data belongs to.

### What is deep learning?

It is a more advanced version of machine learning. The training techniques are significantly improved and models are more complex compared to machine learning.

### Use Cases:

LinearRegression:

* Make prediction on how long will a player reach certain level

* Spawn an enemy where the difficulty is based on input

LogisticRegression:

* Make an enemy that makes decision between 2 choices (e.g. fighting and running)

* Detect hacking players

KMeans:

* Group players in terms of experience level

SupportVectorMachine

* Detect hacking players
