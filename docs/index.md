DataPredict is a machine and deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of machine and deep learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones on Roblox. It is also a way for me to apply my machine and deep learning knowledge into its physical form.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/) or in this [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-mdll-machine-and-deep-learning-library-includes-optimizers-retrainable-models-and-more/2196446?u=myoriginsworkshop) thread.

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

To know what this library is all about from scratch, let's have a look at the quick introduction [here](QuickIntroduction.md).

## Fun Facts About The DataPredict's Icon

The three blocks in the icons represents these meanings, which also show's the DataPredict's Library main design principles:

 * Basic: The icon uses simple blue blocks. This represents that the components of this library are very basic to use.

 * Stackable: The icon shows the blocks are stacking on each other. This represents the components in this library can be stacked over each other.

 * Portable: The three blocks can be unstacked and can move the individual blocks somewhere else. This represents how portable each of the components are when transfering from one system to another.

 Blue colour is chosen as it represents knowledge. This represents the data.

White octagon makes us focus on the blue blocks. This represent the focus on the components of this library.
