<p>DataPredict is a machine and deep learning library for Roblox.

<br><br>This project is created to address the lack of machine and deep learning libraries as well as the inflexibility of the available ones on Roblox. 

<br><br>It is also a way for me to apply my machine and deep learning knowledge into its physical form.

<br><br>If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don’t be afraid to reach out to me at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/">LinkedIn</a> or in this <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/development-pausedrelease-15-datapredict-machine-and-deep-learning-library-reinforcement-learning-retrainable-models-and-more/2196446">DevForum</a> thread.

<br><br>In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in <a href="">YouTube</a>.

<br><br>To know what this library is all about from scratch, let’s have a look at the quick introduction here.
